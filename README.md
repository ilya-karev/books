# React Frontend assignment

## Book discovery application ðŸ“š

**To start project**

- Clone repository
- Install dependencies (npm i)
- Run the application (npm start)

## Assignment

**Write a React application for book discovery using an API that we provide**

- User must be able to discover and search for books
- UI is secondary, donâ€™t waste too much time trying to create a perfect interface, focus on business logic and performance.

## **Technical requirements:**

1. Books screen - Where books from the api are displayed. 
The screen should have a search bar at the top.
While results are loading, the user should see a loading indicator
2. Individual book screen. When the user taps on a book, he gets taken to an individual book screen where he can read the full synopsis of the book
3. We use TypeScript in our projects, so it is required to use it in the assignment

## **Nice to have:**

- Clean and simple code. Write as if somebody will look into your code (because somebody will)
- Performance optimisations (imagine that you have thousands of books in the list)

## Evaluation

1. The way you structure your test code and how you write it
2. Your train of thought
3. Your decision-making
4. Attention to details
